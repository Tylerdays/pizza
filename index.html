        <h2>Welcome to Monia Pizza</h2>
        <p> 
            A bit about us:
            We were founded by one George Derikson in 1988, the founding location of 
            Monia was in a small shop located right by Georges colledge campus at NAIT in Edmonton. 
            The business started off with just a few of Georges classmates but soon was thriving as word spread and soon Monia Pizza had become the center of 
            Georges life as his passion for food exploded. George in an effort to give back has founded multiple scholarships to those seeking to furter their education.
